# Microsoft Todo Gamma
My attempt to impelement the Microsoft ToDo desktop application to work on my skills in [React](https://react.dev/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com), [React Query (Tanstack Query)](https://tanstack.com/query). I also make use of [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) for prebuilt and accessible components, [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for authenitication and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) as the backend.
